# Corey Bothwell

### ✨ I have the following concrete qualifications

- 2.5 years experience in full-stack application development with a product focus
- Strong grasp of computer science fundamentals, including proper data structure and algorithm design along with number and graph theory fundamentals
- Ability to architect a system from start to finish, including important technical decisions such as database architecture
- Excellent grades in the following computer science courses: Data Structures & Algorithms, Software Architecture & Construction, Theoretical Computer Science, Software Engineering, Database Systems & Design, Number Theory
- Experience developing blockchain based applications on the Ethereum Virtual Machine through my Master's Project
- Successful exit of a small 1-person startup (www.avhopper.com)
- I also speak professional level German

### 🧙‍ I have particular experience with following stacks/technologies

- Python with Django, especially Django REST Framework (DRF)
- Java and the Spring Framework
- React and its associated ecosystem (Redux, CRA, Next.js, Gatsby). Strong preference for Typescript ;)
- Front-end UI design for both web and mobile (and I love tailwindCSS!)
- GraphQL
- Database design, both SQL and NoSQL. My SQL experience Postgresql, MSSQL, and MySQL
- Solidity and the Web3 ecosystem, particularly Ethers.js and Hardhat
- AWS including Lambda functions, Dynamo DB, EC2, Fargate, and others along with their counterparts at other vendors
- Microservice & serverless architectures, including where they are best suited and more importantly where they are not
- CI/CD Pipelines via CircleCI, Github Actions, and vendor solutions
- Functional programming paradigms
- Golang
- Elixir/Phoenix (Which I love)
- Docker
- Linux Administration
- Ansible

In the end I see technology as only an enabler of driving user value. I use boring technology where it's best suited, and hang out on the bleeding edge when it brings a competitive advantage. ;)

### ✅ I could be a good fit if your organisation if you're looking for someone who...

- Has a strong sense of ownership of the product and takes responsibility for its improvement and development
- Ideates over architecture and takes an active role in shaping the direction of important technical decisions
- Knows when to listen and learn from senior engineers and is not afraid to admit when they don't know something
- Keeps business value creation at the center of the development process
- Has strong empathy for both colleagues and users and seeks consensus and a shared vision across all stakeholders
